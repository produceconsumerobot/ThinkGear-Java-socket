 * @version		1.0
 * 
 * 
 * This library is following the same design as the one developed by Jorge C. S. Cardoso for the MindSet device.
 * The MindWave device can communicate to a socket over JSON instead of the serial port. That makes it easier and tidier
 * to talk between the device and Java. For instructions on how to use the callback listeners please refer to
 * 
 * http://jorgecardoso.eu/processing/MindSetProcessing/
 * 
 * 
 * Data is passed back to the application via the following callback methods:
 * 
 * 
 * public void attentionEvent(int attentionLevel)
 * Returns the current attention level [0, 100].
 * Values in [1, 20] are considered strongly lowered.
 * Values in [20, 40] are considered reduced levels.
 * Values in [40, 60] are considered neutral.
 * Values in [60, 80] are considered slightly elevated.
 * Values in [80, 100] are considered elevated.
 * 
 * public void meditationEvent(int meditationLevel)
 * Returns the current meditation level [0, 100].
 * The interpretation of the values is the same as for the attentionLevel.
 * 
 * 
 * public void poorSignalEvent(int signalLevel)
 * Returns the signal level [0, 200]. The greater the value, the more noise is detected in the signal.
 * 200 is a special value  that means that the ThinkGear contacts are not touching the skin.
 * 
 * 
 * public void eegEvent(int delta, int theta, int low_alpha, int high_alpha, int low_beta, int high_beta, int low_gamma, int mid_gamma) </code><br>
 * Returns the EEG data. The values have no units.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * public void rawEvent(int [])
 * Returns the the current 512 raw signal samples [-32768, 32767]. 
 * 
 * 
 ****** Modified by Sean Montgomery (www.ProduceConsumeRobot.com) 2013/04 *******
 * https://github.com/produceconsumerobot/
 * - New Feature: Added a method setRawArraySize(int size) to change amount of raw data 
 * that is accumulated before triggering a rawEvent. Default size is 512.
